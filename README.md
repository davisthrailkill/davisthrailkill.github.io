**[Social Determinants Shiny App](/posts/social_determinants.md)**

My application, the [Social Determinants of Health Explorer,](https://davisthrailkill.shinyapps.io/social_determinants_app/) allows health policy analysts and medical researchers a way to explore the relationship between Social Determinants and health outcomes across the 500 most populated cities in the United States. Findings from this application could potentially lead to designing public health programs to better serve populations.
